# Studying
***
This repository is meant to catalogue all the materials I study. It can include simple scripts, readme files containing valuable information, or entire projects that are beneficial to my understanding.

Different languages and coding idealogies will be utilized throughout from frontend to server side and even theories of computer science.

### Useful Terminal Commands
***
- `tsc <filename.ts>`
    - compiles TypeScript file into JavaScript to allow for file execution by using `node <filname.js>`
- `tsc --init`
    - initializes the folder you run the command within as a TypeScript project. Allows for running the `tsc` command without specifiying files
    - Creates a `tsconfig.json` within the TypeScript initialized folder that can be edited such as:
        - compilerOptions -> target
            - May be necessary for updating to a more modern ES in case certain functionality does not work when compiling TypeScript files through the `tsc` command
